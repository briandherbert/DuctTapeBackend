DuctTapeBackend
=========

DuctTapeBackend is a quick-and-dirty way to supply your Android (for now) app with data from afar. You make a Google spreadsheet, and your app pulls in the data as a String[][].  Like duct tape, it is:

  - Single sided. From the device's perspective, the data is read-only
  - Not the Right Way to solve the problem
  - Very quick and easy to use
